// Bob is preparing to pass IQ test. The most frequent task in this test is to find out which one 
// of the given numbers differs from the others. Bob observed that one number usually differs 
// from the others in evenness. Help Bob â€” to check his answers, he needs a program that among 
// the given numbers finds one that is different in evenness, and return a position of this number.

// ! Keep in mind that your task is to help Bob solve a real IQ test, 
// which means indexes of the elements start from 1 (not 0)

// ##Examples :
// iqTest("2 4 7 8 10") => 3 // Third number is odd, while the rest of the numbers are even
// iqTest("1 2 1 1") => 2 // Second number is even, while the rest of the numbers are odd

const iqTest = (numbers) => {
  let odds = 0;
  let evens = 0;

  const numbersArr = numbers
    .split(" ")
    .filter((number) => number !== " ")
    .map((number) => {
      number = +number;
      return number % 2 === 0;
    });

  numbersArr.forEach((number) => {
    number === true ? evens++ : odds++;
  });

  return evens > odds
    ? numbersArr.indexOf(false) + 1
    : numbersArr.indexOf(true) + 1;
};

// tests
console.log(iqTest("2 4 7 8 10"));
console.log(iqTest("1 2 2"));
